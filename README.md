# Project Setup

## Option A: Docker Setup *(recommended)*
Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
Run the following command in a terminal to build and run a new container:
```
bash scripts/run_app_in_docker.sh
```
*Note: I recommend this setup to ensure that none of your current local dependencies
gets changed/updated inadvertently. A docker container ensures isolation and makes it easy to deploy apps regardless of the current machine's setup.*
